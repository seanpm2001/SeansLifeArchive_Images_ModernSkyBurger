# SeansLifeArchive_Images_ModernSkyBurger
The module for my life story project that contains my Modern Sky Burger images. For the better classic game, I will host pictures of it in the future, when I can find an APK file. [Click/tap here to view the classic sky burger images]()

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all weekly Modern Sky Burger session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.SkyBurger&hl=en&gl=US) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Sky Burger all the way back in 2012 and 2013. I started playing again in 2020 during my NImbleBIt fan phase, but the game changed way too much, and now I consider it as "modern sky burger" which I identify as a poorly made game.

On October 22nd 2020, I deleted the app off my phone. I hope to play the classic version again someday (along with scoops)
