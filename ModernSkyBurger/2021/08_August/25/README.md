# Modern Sky Burger session August 25th 2021

I did my weekly session this week, this game had no problems loading. This game is basically just a weekly ad compilation at this point, I don't know how to make gameplay look good with only screenshots with my timing. I saved up over 400 bux today, and didn't buy anything new. I ran out of ads quickly.

## Ads

I let ads play today to try to gain as much bux as I could, but the game ran out of ads quickly, and so I quit early. <!-- I prepared my laptop, went outside, and did some basic chores as I waited through the first of the crappy ads, but then focused on documenting the ads, as there were some ridiculous ones today. !-->

<!-- This was mainly just ads today, I stopped early on, as it wasn't worth my time (I mostly wrote notes on my laptop during this time) I stopped at a palindrome of 27272 (minus the 80 cents) !-->

## Overview

See above.
