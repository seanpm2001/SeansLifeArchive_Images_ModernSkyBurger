# March 30th 2021 - Didn't play

I didn't play Modern Sky Burger today. I took a break from it, as I am now on a schedule to play this game weekly. However, I still miss the classic version.

I am playing the modern version of this game, which I won't enjoy it as much as the 2012 version of the game.

I started fresh on January 2nd 2021. I am playing without tilt controls. The gaming schedule for this game is now every Wednesday.

I didn't play the game today. I will be playing again on Wednesday, March 31st 2021.
