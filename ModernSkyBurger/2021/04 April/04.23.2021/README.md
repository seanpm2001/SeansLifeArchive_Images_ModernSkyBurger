# April 23rd 2021 - Didn't play

I didn't play Modern Sky Burger today. I took a break from it, as I am now on a schedule to play this game weekly. However, I still miss the classic version.

## Game version

I am playing the modern version of this game, which I won't enjoy it as much as the 2012 version of the game.

I started fresh on January 2nd 2021. I am playing without tilt controls. The gaming schedule for this game is now every Wednesday.

## Why?

Due to a discovery on Saturday, October 24th 2020 about how much time all games together take up, and how little time it leaves me, I had to make a schedule change for gaming, splitting all 25 games I play across a 7 day period, instead of all in 1 day.

## When will you come back?

I didn't play the game today. I will be playing again on Wednesday, April 28th 2021.
