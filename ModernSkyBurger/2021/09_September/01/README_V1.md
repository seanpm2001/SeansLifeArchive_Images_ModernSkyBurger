# Modern Sky Burger session 2021 September 1st

I did my weekly session this week, this game had no problems loading. This game is basically just a weekly ad compilation at this point, I don't know how to make gameplay look good with only screenshots with my timing. I saved up over 500 bux today, and didn't buy anything new. I didn't run out of ads, but felt like qitting.

## Ads

I let ads play today to try to gain as much bux as comfortably possible. <!-- I prepared my laptop, went outside, and did some basic chores as I waited through the first of the crappy ads, but then focused on documenting the ads, as there were some ridiculous ones today. !-->

<!-- This was mainly just ads today, I stopped early on, as it wasn't worth my time (I mostly wrote notes on my laptop during this time) I stopped at a palindrome of 27272 (minus the 80 cents) !-->

## Overview

See above.
