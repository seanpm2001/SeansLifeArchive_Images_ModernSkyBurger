# Modern Sky Burger session May 12th 2021

I had a usual Modern Sky Burger session today and only watched ads. I made a lot less bux today. I tried to keep it short.

## Ads

This was mainly just ads today, I stopped early on, as it wasn't worth my time (I mostly wrote notes on my laptop during this time) I stopped at a palindrome of 27272 (minus the 80 cents)

## Overview

See above.
