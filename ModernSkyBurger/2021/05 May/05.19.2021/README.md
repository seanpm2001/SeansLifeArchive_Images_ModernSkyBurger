# Modern Sky Burger session May 19th 2021

I game wouldn't load today on the first attempt, so I didn't play at all. I didn't attempt to debug, as it didn't seem worth my time. See below for more info.

## Ads

I am considering completely stopping my gameplay of this game again, as I have been doing nothing but let ads play while I do other things, so it is pointless. It honestly isn't that good of a game anymore, considering the bad graphics, and the fact that watching ads are over twice more rewarding than actually playing the game.

<!-- This was mainly just ads today, I stopped early on, as it wasn't worth my time (I mostly wrote notes on my laptop during this time) I stopped at a palindrome of 27272 (minus the 80 cents) !-->

## Overview

See above.
