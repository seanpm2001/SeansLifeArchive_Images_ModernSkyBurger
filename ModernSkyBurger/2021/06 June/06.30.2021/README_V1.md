# Modern Sky Burger session June 30th 2021

I did my weekly session this week, this game had no problems loading. This game is basically just a weekly ad compilation at this point, I don't know how to make gameplay look good with only screenshots with my timing. I saved up less than 1000 bux today, and didn't buy anything new.

## Ads

I let ads play today to gain over 1500 bux. I prepared my laptop, went outside, and did some basic chores as I waited through the first of the crappy ads, but then focused on documenting the ads, as there were some ridiculous ones today.

<!-- This was mainly just ads today, I stopped early on, as it wasn't worth my time (I mostly wrote notes on my laptop during this time) I stopped at a palindrome of 27272 (minus the 80 cents) !-->

## Overview

See above.
